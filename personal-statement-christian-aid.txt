I believe I would be an excellent fit for the Developer (Full-stack) role at Christian Aid, not only because of my technical expertise but because of my genuine alignment with your mission to create a world where everyone can live a full life, free from poverty. Your values of dignity, equality, justice, and love resonate deeply with my own commitment to using technology as a force for positive change.

From a technical perspective, my experience perfectly matches the 70% frontend and 30% backend split required for this role. I have extensive experience in frontend development using React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Vue.js, consistently delivering user-centric, accessible interfaces that meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. My backend expertise includes PHP, Laravel, Go, and database management with MySQL and MongoDB, which positions me well to work with Drupal CMS. While I have direct experience with WordPress and WooCommerce, I'm familiar with CMS architecture and am confident in my ability to quickly adapt to Drupal, given my track record of rapidly mastering new technologies and frameworks.

What sets me apart is my proven ability to work closely with stakeholders and translate complex technical concepts into accessible language. In my current role as Frontend Developer & Team Lead at Tech N' Goodwill Limited, I regularly collaborate with UI/UX designers, marketing teams, backend engineers, and business stakeholders to architect solutions that align with both user needs and organisational goals. I've established engineering standards around accessibility compliance, performance benchmarks, and best practices, ensuring that every product we deliver not only functions well but is inclusive and accessible to all users.

My commitment to accessibility isn't just professional—it's personal. I understand that digital products must be accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities, and I've consistently implemented semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility in all my projects. This aligns perfectly with Christian Aid's commitment to inclusivity and ensuring that your digital fundraising initiatives reach and serve diverse audiences.

Beyond my commercial experience, I have direct experience working with mission-driven organisations. I had the privilege of working with Reach Afrika, an NGO focused on community development and empowerment. I built their website from the ground up, ensuring it effectively communicated their mission and impact. Beyond the technical implementation, I consulted and advised them on their technical infrastructure and public appearance, helping them present their work in a way that resonated with supporters and stakeholders. This experience taught me how to balance technical excellence with the unique needs and constraints of non-profit organisations, and how digital presence can amplify their impact.

Additionally, I am actively involved in my church community, where I serve in the technical unit. I assist with promotion content creation, social media management, photography, and videography—all aimed at increasing visibility and engagement. I'm currently building a website for the church to enhance its online presence and reach. This volunteer work has deepened my understanding of how technology can serve communities and amplify important messages. It has also reinforced my appreciation for Christian Aid's faith identity and your approach to welcoming people of all faiths and none, united by shared values of dignity, equality, and justice.

What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to contribute to digital fundraising initiatives that directly support Christian Aid's mission. My experience with real-time applications, AI-powered features, and high-performance web applications has prepared me to tackle the complex technical challenges of developing and maintaining digital products at scale. I'm a proactive problem solver with a user-centric approach, and as a strong communicator, I effectively collaborate with both technical teams and non-technical stakeholders to ensure solutions align with user needs and business goals.

I'm particularly drawn to Christian Aid's commitment to building diverse and inclusive teams, and I would be honoured to contribute to that mission. My experience leading cross-functional teams and my passion for continuous learning make me well-suited to work alongside your Technical Lead. I bring not just the technical skills required for this role, but a genuine passion for using technology to create positive change, direct experience working with mission-driven organisations, and a deep appreciation for Christian Aid's values and mission.
